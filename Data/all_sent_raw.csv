I don't understand your question.,Would you mind just repeating the question?
I don't wanna attend a work event during my personal time. ,I am unavailable to attend after working hours

I hate to bother you but I want your opinion on this ,"Whenever you have a few moments, I would like to discuss something with you"
I hate your idea.,Let’s circle back on this
I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about,Can you help me better understand what exactly is it that you require on my end?
I have more important things to do than talk to you right now.,I value your opinion and would love to pick up this conversation at another time.
I have no idea how to answer that question.,"That is not my area of expertise, but I will connect with my team and follow up with you on that."
I have no idea how to do this task,I think I can manage this new task but would love another set of eyes on it just in case

i need to explain to you in private why your idea sucks,"Could you run that question past me again, please?"
I need your answer and I need it fast,Thank you for your timely response.
I never agreed to do that.,It appears that we had different expectations on who is responsible for completing this.
I never thought about that.,Let me come back to you on that.
I think that's a bad idea.,maybe we should re think this together.
I told you so,"As per my prediction, this outcome does not come as a surprise."
I told you so and now this is your problem,I did previously note that this was a likely outcome. How do you plan to resolve this?
I told you so.,"If I recall, we'd discussed this as an outcome. I know that there were a few alternatives and contingencies that some of us came up with individually so this might be a good time for us to reraise that topic as a group."
I told you so.,"Judging from my instinct, this outcome really doesn’t look unexpected to me!"
"I told you this so many times, can you just write it down?",I encourage you to document and save this information so you can access it in the future when you need it.
I totally forgot about your email.,This one fell through the cracks. My apologies
I totally spaced out.,"I’m sorry, I missed that. Could you say it again, please?"
"I wanna work here, but if another year goes by without getting a raise I'm going to have to start applying elsewhere.",I'm requesting a meeting to review my compansation and better understand if my salar ywill be adjusted to reflect the market rate and my contributions to the company more accurately.
I want a higher salary than you are offering me.,I was hoping to be in the 180k to 220k salary range for this position.
I will join the meeting if I'll have nothing better to do.,I will do my best to make it to that meeting
"I'll provide an update when I have one, stop bothering me!",You have not heard from me because further information is not available at this time. Once I have an update I'll be sure to loop you in.

"I'm entitled to take my paid days off, don't make me feel bad about it. ","Paid days off are part of my total compensation and I'm entitled to take them, If you have any issues with this I have to loop in HR."
I'm giving you a shit ton of work,If it’s not too much trouble
I'm going to need a whole lot of more information if you want this me to do this,Please let me know when further details become available as I require more information to successfully complete this task
"I'm hungover as shit, working from home, don't bother me",Feel free to ping me
"I'm not a mind reader, how was I supposed to know that?",This was not communicated to me prior to this
I'm not canceling my vacation because you moved the project timeline!,My time off has been approved and I am not able to adjuct the dates on my end due to last minute changes in our timeline.
I'm not going to that meeting because it's after my working hours.,"I'm unable to attend a meeting at this time, is there a possibility to move this between 9 to 5?"
I'm not interested.,"I appreciate the invite, but I am completely booked."
I'm not interested.,"I appreciate the offer, but I can't commit."
I'm not interested.,"I'm flattered you considered me, but unfortunately I'll have to pass this time."
I'm not interested.,"I'm honored by the invite, but unfortunately cannot attend."
I'm not interested.,"Thank you for thinking of me, but I can't."
I'm not staying late to deal with this.,My workday concludes at 5 but I would be happy to prioritize this first thing tomorrow.
I'm not working late today.,Sorry but my evening is booked with other commitments.
I'm too busy,"Once I complete my current task, I'll be happy to take a look at that."
I've told you this multiple times.,There seems to be a disconnect here as this information has already been provided.
I’m not attending this meeting because it’s a waste of my time.,Declining this invite as I do not feel as though I’m able to add value to this meeting.
I’m not doing your job for you,I do not have the capacity to take this on in addition to my own workload but I’m happy to support where it makes sense.
I’m not going to redo work for you. Stop being lazy.,Reattached for your convenience
Are you stupid or what?,Let me clarify
I’m not sorry. A five year old could understand this.,Apologies for being unclear
"I’m not wrong. You said what you said, stop backtracking.","Correct me if I’m wrong, but I recall that you said something else previously. "
"I’m sending the same email to thousands of people, your reply would be appreciated.",I know you’ve probably had ten of these emails so I’ll get straight to the point…
"I’m snowed under with important stuff, this is not one of those things.",Apologies for my delayed response…
I’ve not been properly trained on this,Is training available in order for me to successfully complete this?
I’ve told this to you many times,"There is an apparent disconnect here, given that this information has been provided. Im of course happy to re-share this information if you need to revisit it."

"If I don't get a raise this year, I'm quitting this job.",Are there any actions that I can take in order to be considered for a pay raise this year?
"If I’m doing your job for you, then what are you doing all day?",Is there a higher priority task that is consuming all of your capacity at the moment?
"If we do that, we’re going bankrupt.","If we do that, it will cost considerably more than the current scope."
"If we go with that option, we’re screwed.","We could go for this option, but I think first we'd need to take time outside of this meeting to properly scope out and assess the multi-year maintenance requirements"
If you can’t pay any more then what else can you offer.,"I understand there are budget restrictions that limit your ability to increase my salary. However, I would like to understand if additional vacation days, benefits, bonus, and other overall compensation items can be offered."
If you don't RSVP by Wednesday don't come crying to me when there is no food for you.,We need a count of how many people to provide food for. Please RSVP by Wednesday so we can include you.
"If you don’t like the estimate, you can go fuck yourself.","Sorry, but I can't cut costs anymore and still give you what you want. I don't think we will be a good fit. I will have to pass on this project."
If you expect me to do the job of three people then I expect the salary of three people.,"Are additional team members being added to take on these roles, or will I be expected to absorb these responsibilities? If the latter, I’d be happy to set up some time to discuss appropriate compensation for this role expansion."
"If you have me schduled in meeting all day, when do you expect me to get this work done?","My calander is currently heavily scheduled with meetings. To ensure appropriate time is available to get this done, I can sit out of lower priority meeting or extend the deadlines for my tasks."
If you want it done your way then just do it yourself.,"As you seem to have a very clear vision for the execution of this, I encourage you to take the lead here and I’m happy to support you where necessary."
"If you want me to accept this job, pay me what I asked for.","Unfortunately, we have chosen not to move forward with your proposal at this time. Though your proposal is impressive, we are unable to fit your work into our budget. We wish you the best with your future endeavors and hope for the chance to work with each other in the future."
"If you would have read the whole email, you would have seen the answer to this question.",I have included my original response listed below that contains all the specifics you are requesting.
"If you're gonna present my work, at least give me credit for it",I understand you have presented my work to a wider audience and wanted to confirm that I was given proper credit for my ideas. 
"If your meeting has no agenda, I'm not gonna attend it.",Can you please share an agenda as to what this meeting is?
Are you okay with my idea? I can't tell.,Is this what you had in mind?
Is that ok?,Let me know if I should proceed
Is the manager of this role a micromanager?,How involved is the reporting manager with this role?
it is not working for me,"That sounds so exciting, but we'll have to wait for another time"
it is not working for me,"Unfortunately, that's just not possible. It won't work out this time."
It's no urgent just because you want it to be. ,"I understand this is a priority for you and I will get to it when I am able to, as I'm currently working on more pressing items. "
it's not interesting,"I believe I wouldn’t fit the bill, sorry."
it's not interesting,I don’t think I’m the right person for that.
it's not interesting,I’m not sure I’m the best for it.
it's not interesting,It doesn’t sound like the right fit.
it's not interesting,It’s not a good idea for me.
It's not my fault you procrectinated on this. ,"I understand the urgency on this with the deadline approaching. However, I am not able to reschedule my entire week to prioritize this last minute. "
it's not my problem,Could we discuss this further in a team meeting?
it's not my problem,I wasn't aware of that - thank you for letting me know. Looping in Jeff who might be able to assist you with this. 
it's not my problem,"I wasn't involved with this part of the project, but please tell me the correct way to handle this situation."
it's not my problem,"This is what we agreed on when we started this project, if you wish to make changes please speak with the project manager. "
It's time you learn how to spell my name correctly. ,I'd appreciate you spell my name correctly when addressing me. 
It's too hard,That's a challenge

Just a heads up,You should be aware
Just So You Know,Are You Aware?
Leave me alone and let me do my job. ,If you could give me some space to complete my work that would be very helpful. 
Leave me alone and let me do this job!,I'm working on addressing this and would benefit from working independently here.
"Leave me alone, I'm trying to get my work done.",My focus right now is on completing this work nd I am limited on time today.
Let's get started,Get the ball rolling.
Maybe if you communicated that with us sooner we wouldn’t be in this mess.,In the future it is important to share information like this with the team sooner so we might mitigate these sort of issues.
maybe try not to be such a fuckup next time.,Moving Forward
Mess around and you'll find out.,I encourage you to proof of concept this idea to understand its viability.
My job has evolved but my salary has stayed the same.,"As my role has expanded since joining the company, I would like to review my compensation so that it better reflects my evolved responsibilities."
My workload is so heavy because you keep rewarding good work with more work.,"I appreciate the opportunity to take on more responsibility. However, my workload has become quite heavy and I would like to better understand what items are priorities."

Oops! I completely forgot to reply.,I apologize for the late response.
Our deadline is approaching. Hurry up!,"As our deadline is quickly approaching, can you provide an update as to where you are in completing this task?"

"Read the manual I wrote, it exists exactly so you won't have to bother me with the same question every time.",I think the information here will be very useful. Please review it at your convenience. Let me know if you have any questions regarding it.

"Shit, I forgot about your email. ",Thank you for your patience.
"Shit, I forgot it was due today!","I will have this information sent to you today, as requested."
"Shit, my bad.",Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.
So you expect me to take on more work but pay me the same?,Is the expectation here that my responsibilities and workload are evolving but I am to remain with the same job title and compensation?
Sorry this is late.,Thanks for your patience
Sorry to bug you!,Thank you for your time
Why do you think you have a say in this?,There seems to be a disconnect here as this information has already been provided
Stay in your lane.,"Thank you for your input, I'll keep that in mind."
Stay in your lane.,"Thanks for your input, I'll keep that in mind as I move forward with decisions that fall within my responsibility."
Stop adding me to these irrelevant email chains.,"Moving forward, can we include more of a focused group on these emails to avoid cluttering up the inboxes of those who are not directly working on this?"
Stop adding to the scope of work with false expectations of time.,"As the scope of work is pre-determined, it may be time to sit down and re-visit this to get a better expectation of the project timeline. And, if we need to add to the scope, we can certanily see how much time (expected) will be added to the project."
Stop assigning me so many tasks if you want any of them done.,"As my workload is quite heavy, can you help me understand what I should reprioritise in order to accommodate this new task?"
Stop bombarding me with messages. ,"To ensure that information does not get missed, can you please condence your communicationsinto a single email where possible?"
Stop CC'ing everyone. ,"To optimize communication, perhaps we can target these emails to a moer focused group?"

Stop emailing me so much.,"You have not heard from me because further information is not available at this time, once I have an update I’ll be sure to loop you in."
Stop excluding me from important meetings.,"Please include me in all future meetings pertaining to this topic, as my involvement is necessary."
Stop excluding me from meetings that I should be in.,"My involvement in these conversations is necessary, So I'm requesting that you start adding me to these meetings moving forward."
Stop following up every 20 minutes. I’ll get back to you when I can.,I would appreciate your patience as I need time to address this. I will provide an update once one is available.
Stop ignoring me.,"I know you are busy, and would appreciate your reply when you have time. "
Stop ignoring my meeting requests!,Your attendance is required for this discussion. If this date/time does not work on your end please propose a new time that works for you
Stop ignoring my messages!,"I understand this is a busy time and if it is easier for you to jump on a call I am happy to set up some time in order to get this resolved., "
Stop micromanaging.,"I am confident in my ability to complete this project and will be sure to reach out, if or when I require your input."
Stop micromanaging.,This falls outside my responsibilities but I would be happy to connect you with someone who can help
Stop promising unrealistic timelines.,Can you walk me through your thinking on these timelines? I have some hesitations with the dates shared.
Stop texting my personal phone about work. ,Please direct all work related inquiries to my email so communications are kept in one place.

Stop trying to make me do your work!,"I am not able to offer you additional support in completing your workload, as i am at capacity with my own assigned responsibilities"
"Sucks for you, but that's the deal.",I hope you can understand.
Thank you.,I appreciate your attention to this matter
Thanks for doing your fucking job.,Thank you for your support
Thanks for the advice I didn't ask for.,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts, I will keep them in mind."
Thanks for this useless email.,"Thank you for sending this email, I will save this information so I can refer back to it as necessary."
That idea is going to be an epic fail.,I am not in agreement with this idea and have hesitations moving forward.
That meeting sounds like a waste of my time.,I’m unable to add value to this meeting but I would be happy to review the minutes.
That sounds like a horrible idea.,"Are we confident that this solution is the very best, or are we still exploring possible alternatives?"
That sounds like a you problem.,I believe that falls within your scope of responsibilities.
That sucks for me.,Thank you for letting me know.
"That timeline is impossible, you need to adjust you expectations. ","To ensure we are setting realistic timelines, let's break down our milestones to create a more detailed picture of what this project will look like. "
That will never work. ,I am happy to explore this option but I do have some hesitations on the viability 
That's above my pay grade.,This doesn't fall within my scope of responsibilities.
That's not my job.,"This falls outside of my responsibilities, but I would be happy to connect you with someone who can help."
That's not my problem. ,What you are describing is not somehting within my control.
That's not part of my job.,I am not the correct person to assist with this but I am happy to connect you with my teammate who will be able to help. 
That's not what I asked.,"My question may not have been specific enough, I would like to clarify it further"
The way you speak to me is disrespectful.,"I encourage you to reevaluate the way you are speaking to me, as the disrespect you are currently displaying towards me is not welcomed nor will it be tolerated."
they don't pay me enough to help you too.,"Unfortunately, I have too much to do today. I can help you another time"
"This decision was made weeks ago, why are you bringing this up now?",These concerns were not raised during any of our previous discussions. Has something changed since the decision has been made?
This doesn't make any sense.,We have a different perspective on this. Do you have a more detailed explanation?
This falls outside of my scope.,"As it turns out, this particular request falls outside of our responsibilities for this project. Im happy to discuss adding this to our scope of work if it’s necessary."
This is not my job.,I can’t help you due to personal reasons.
This is not my job.,"I would love to help, but I don’t have the capacity."
This is not my job.,"I'd love to be able to assist you with this task. However, our supervisor originally assigned this task to you, and the task isn't within the scope of my responsibilities. I'm going to politely decline, and I recommend speaking to management to find a solution."
This is not my job and sounds like it would suck all of my time and energy. ,"The project sounds exciting, and I can't wait to see the direction you take it. Unfortunately, I don't think I have the capacity to take on this much responsibility outside of my usual tasks. Please let me know if there are any smaller, less time-consuming items I can help with to support the team."
This is not my problem.,I recommend directing this issue to the IT team as they have the proper expertise to best assist you
This is urgent.,Please prioritize this as soon as possible.
This isn't life or death.,Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the urgency here
this isn't worth my time.,I'm not comfortable doing that task.
this isn't worth my time.,Now isn't a good time for me.
this isn't worth my time.,"Sorry, I have already committed to something else."
this isn't worth my time.,"That sounds fun, but I have a lot going on at home."
this isn't worth my time.,"Unfortunately, I have too much to do today."
This isn’t my job – don’t ask me to do it.,Not sure this was meant for me.
This meeting sounds like a waste of both of our time.,"I cannot be of value in this appointment, but I’m happy to be available for a review of the important points, or even to correspond by email."
This might sound stupid ,Here’s something to consider
This solution is just bad.,Interesting solution. Did we also explore other alternatives?
try again.,"Could you run that question past me again, please?"
Try problem solving on your own before you come to me.,I encourage you to brainstorm possible solutions prior to looping me in for additional support.
This is so unprofessional.,"Put aside any negative feelings, let's bring this topic up at another time."
We do not need to have a meeting about this.,Being respectful of everyone's time let's discuss this through email until we have a more defined agenda.
We don't need to have a meeting about this.,"I do not feel as though a meeting is required at the time, and recommend we continue to discuss this over Email."
"We’ve already discussed this, read your emails properly.",Per my last email
What am I supposed to do with this information?,Thanks for the heads up.
what did you just asked?,Could you just clarify your question for me?
What do you want?,Is there something that you require on my end?
What is this meeting even for?,Is there an agenda?
What the actual fuck?,"I'm out of the loop, help me understand the rationale please."
What the fuck did you just say?,Kindly explain your thought process
What you are saying does not make sense.,We seem to have different understanding on this. Can you elaborate further on your thought process here?
What you are saying is nonesense.,Can you help me understand how you arrived at that conclusion?
What you say sounds crazy.,Would you mind walking me through your thought process?
"When I'll want your input, I'll ask for it. ","Thank you for sharing your thoughts, I will be sure to reach out if further input is required. "
While I'm on vacation don't try to contact me. Just pretend I don't exist. ,While I am off I will not be reachable so please do not expect a response. For urgent matters you can contact my manager.
Why are you asking me? it's not my job.,"Thank you for reaching out, let me redirect you to Samantha who can assist you with this."
Why are you late again?,Thank you for joining us
Why didn't you ask me for this sooner?,Given the tight turnaround it would have been beneficial to have been looped in on this sooner.
Why didn't you tell me that the first time?,This would have been valuable to communicate earlier on this process.
Why don't you share important information with the people it impacts most?,This information has a great impact on those who are not being currently communicated with.
Why have you not approved my time off yet?,I wanted to confirm that you have received my time off request and understand if there is anything further you require on my end for this to be reviewed. 
Why was'nt I informed sooner?,Thanks for keeping me in the loop.
Why would I go to the office if I can do my job from home?,Can you help me understand why I am required to be in the office when I can effectively execute my job responsibilities remotely?
WTF.,Can you elaborate on that?
You are capable of doing this on your own. ,I am confident in your knowledge on this topic and encourage you to take the lead.
You are not my boss so stop acting like it. ,"In case you were not aware of our organizational structure, I report to Alice and take direction from her."
"You are not my boss, stop trying to assign me work.",Have you connected with my manager in regards to me taking this on? As it has not been communicated to me that I’ll be working on this.
You are not my boss.,"I can look at prioritising this behind my assigned responsibilities, though I will have to ensure that with my manager."
You are not pulling your weight on this project. ,Our contributions on this project to date do not appear to be equal. Will your involvment be increasing as the timeline continues?
You are overcomplicating this.,Being mindful of timelines. Let’s concentrate on the initial scope.
You are underpaying me.,There is a notable discrepancy between my current salary and the going market rate for the comparable roles.
You are wasting my time.,Being respectful of time let’s regroup when more details become available.
Your'e asking for too much.,We'll need to manage expectations.
"You can send your email outside of my working hours, but I'm not going to respond or read them.",Please note that my inbox is monitored within regular working hours.
You didn't answer my question.,"Perhaps it was overlooked, but I asked this question and didn’t get a complete reply regarding it."
You didn't explain this point.,could you please elaborate on this subject?
"You didn't give me clear instructions, how was I supposed to know that?",I did my best with the information I was provided.
You Didn’t Answer My Question.,"You shared so much today; it is going to take time for it to all sink in. I was jotting down some key points along the way. I also wrote down a few questions, and they weren’t answered when you finished. Do you mind if I ask them now?"
You don't know what you're talking about.,Your input is so valuable
you don't let me talk.,Can I just say something here?
you don't understand me.,Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.
You don’t have a choice.,Thanks in advance
You fucked up.,"Well, you’ve provided us all with a great opportunity for education on this matter."
You go over my work so much you may as well just do it yourself.,I appreciate your thourogh attentiveness on my deliverables. To ensure we are not duplicating work please let me know in the future if you'd like to take this on yourself. 
You have to be more clear on what you want. ,"In order to successfuly complete this, I will need further details on what is required. "
"You know this already, and denying that will now make you look stupid.",As no doubt you are aware…
"You messed it up last time, it better not happen again.",I am bringing this to your attention so we don’t have the same outcome as we had last time
You messed up. Don’t do it again.,"Going forward, I would prefer that you…"
"You need to start pulling your weight, I can't keep doing your work for you.","I understand you're responsible for completing this, my own workload is demanding and doesn't lend me the time to complete this for you."
"You should be the one doing this, not me.",It is my understanding that this is your responsibility. If that is not the case please let me know.
You're crazy thinking I will spend my weekend working on this project.,"Thank you for the offer to do the project, but this weekend doesn’t work for me."
You're holding everyone up by not completing this task.,I an checking in to see if you have an ETA on when this will be completed. Your task needs to be done in order for us to continue working on our pieces.
you're not my boss,"Unfortunately, I have too much to do today. I can help you another time"
"you're not my boss, asshole.",Could I pick up with you after the meeting to discuss this in more detail?
you're trying to rip us off.,We're looking for a better price.
You're wrong.,I understand.
You're wrong.,I feel different about this topic.
You’re an idiot.,I find your ideas to be both thought-provoking and challenging to implement.
You’re wasting everyone’s time.,Let’s take this offline.
You’ve had more than enough time – where’s what I asked for?,Friendly reminder
You’ve really pissed me off.,:)
Your communication could not have been less clear.,I'm struggling to understand your vision here.
Your job is what I say it is.,"I know this is not what you wanted, but this is what I need you to do."
Your micromanaging isn’t making this go any faster.,"Though I appreciate your attention to this, I feel as though I could be more productive if I had an opportunity to work independently here."
Your mistake was stupid.,Can you think of a way we can avoid this in the future?
Your'e not doing your job properly and it's making more job for me.,"Iv''e noticed that there are a few tasks that are not being completed properly, and I wanted to check in and see if you wanted to go over them together to avoid rework on my side. "
