"Don't ask me again about meeting up, I'm not into it. ",Now isn’t a good time for me. I’ll let you know if my schedule frees up.
Don't bother me until thursday.,let's be in touch with you by the end of the week.
Don't expect me to do that.,Your expectations are undersood and I promise to do my absolute best.
Don't interrupt me.,"Thank you for you input, but please wait until I am finished sharing my thoughts before proceeding."
Don't nag us about this.,We will make sure to keep you posted.
"Don't try to do my job, stay in your lane.",Thank you for your input. I’ll keep that in mind as I move forward with this project!
Don't undestand you.,"Sorry, I can’t hear you very well, could you speak a little louder/ speak up, please?"
"Even if I had time, and I don't, I wouldn't do it. ","Bandwidth is low, so I won’t be able to make it work."

Fuck you.,Have a nice day!
FYI.,In case it is helpful to know this.
Get off.,"With all due respect, I feel this conversation isn’t going anywhere. And think we should agree to disagree."
Google that for yourself.,The internet is a great resource for these type of questions and I am available to clarify elements that you are not able to find online.
Got it?,"Should you have questions, please feel free to contact me."
Hahaha I'm not doing that.,"Regrettably, i’m not able to."
Hahaha no way I'm saying yes.,Let me think about it and i’ll get back to you.

He works for me.,We work together.
Help me!,Any help on this matter will be greatly appreciated.
Hire more people or this isn't going to get done.,The team is already at capacity and will require additional resources in order to get tihs completed.
Holy shit you’re stupid.,There's not a single professional in my industry who would suggest that.

How you could have fucked this up so badly?,Please advise.
Hurry up!,"Seems like you need some help with that, would you like me to assist you?"
I already have too much work for a single person. ,At the moment I am not taking on new things.
I already made plans that I'd much rather go to instead of this. ,"Oh, I wish there were two of me!"
I already told you this.,As indicated prior.
I am burning out with this workload and your lack of support.,My productivity is being impacted by the overwhelming workload I am currently assigned. Is there any support you or the team can offer?
I am making less than I should be in this role.,"After analyzing the current market rate for comparable roles to mine, I understand that I am making $2000 less than the going rate."
I am not paid enough to do this.,This falls out of my job description but if the opportunity for a role expansion becomes available I would be happy to discuss reworking my contract to better align with these new responsibilities.
I am overworked. ,I’m really maxed out.
I am really unmotivated these days.,"I’m really spread thin these days, I just can’t take it on right now."
I am so bored at this job!,"As I have some bandwidth at the moment, I'm wondering if there is an opportunity to be involved in another project."
I assumed you wouldn't mind.,My understanding was that you were on board with this.
I can not possibly read your mind.,I’ll need more information about the concerned matter in order to complete this. Please be as specific as possible.
I can't believe you left me to do all this work alone while your'e on vacation.,Enjoy your time with friends and family!
I can't continue until you do this.,Just checking in on the below discussion.
I can't do a task that I don't understand half the words in it's description.,"Since I'm not qualified to do that, so I'm afraid I won't be able to help."
I can't do my job unless you do yours.,Your support is appreciated.
I can't do my job with you hovering over everything I do.,This work could be completed more efficiently if I had the opportunity to work more independently here.
I can't handle any more work without losing my will to live. ,I’m not taking on anything else right now.
I can't help you because your face annoys me. ,I can’t help you due to personal reasons.
I can't trust them with this task.,Make sure to keep an eye on their progress on this task.
I can’t read your mind. Be more clear on what you want.,In order to successfully complete this I will need further details on what is required.
I can’t take on anymore work right now.,I am unable to take that on at the moment as my current workload is quite heavy. Is there someone else who can assist with this?
"I could do it, but I won't do it for you.","So sorry, but it's out of my hands."
I couldn't be happier to decline this invite. ,Darn! not able to fit it in.
I couldn't care less.,I will defer to your judgment on this as I am not passionate either way and I trust your expertise.
I deserve a raise.,Given my contributions to the company’s success along with a current market analysis of my role. I am setting up time to discuss a salary review.
I disagree with everything you just said.,I am not aligned with what you have shared here.
I disagree with your idea.,"I see what you mean, but I think that my solution is more suitable in this scenario."
I don't believe you.,I am not confident that the information you have provided is correct.
I don't care.,Let me know how that works out.
I don't feel like coming. ,"I’m just swamped right now, so I can’t."
I don't get it.,Am I correct in understanding that.
I don't get paid enough to deal with this bulshit. ,This falls outside my responsibilities but I would be happy to connect you with someone who can help.
I don't give a fuck.,"Well, the weather sure is great today, don’t you think?"
"I don't have anything planned, I just really don't want to come.",Sadly I’m booked into something else.
I don't have the time.,Perhaps next season when things clear up.
I don't have the time.,Right now I’ve got too much on my plate.
I don't have time for your bullshit right now.,Would you mind if we circle back on this? I want to make sure to give this the attention it deserves.
I don't know why you thought I could help with that.,Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
I don't know.,I'll find out.
I don't like it.,Why don't we think about it again?
I don't need to be included in this.,"I do not feel as though I am able to add value to this conversation, please remove me from this thread and feel free to loop me back in the future if required."
I don't understand your question.,Would you mind just repeating the question?
I don't wanna attend a work event during my personal time.,I am unavailable to attend after working hours.
I don't wanna work with you more than I absolutely have to.,Would you be open to replacing our frequent communications with a monthly touch base where we can discuss all updated during that time?
I don't want to come.,I will get back to you after I check my calendar.
I don't want to do this project even if you think it is a good opportunity. ,"That's nice of you, I'm flattered that you thought of me for that project, but no, thank you."
I don't want to go out to get beers after work with you. ,I have a few things I need to take care of first. Can I let you know later?
I don't want to have small talk with you. ,"Sorry, but I’m buried in work, catch up another day?"
I don't want to take on more work for the same amount of pay.,"With this expension of job responsibility, i'd like to review my compensation to better reflect this new role."
I don't want to talk to you right now.,"Currently I am tied up with something, but I will connect you once I am free."
I don’t believe you.,I’m not confident that the information you have provided is correct.
I don’t even understand what your'e asking,Could you just clarify your question for me?
I don’t fucking understand what you want from me.,I'm not confident that I have the full perspective here. 
"I don’t give a shit about your personal life, but I have to pretend that I do for the sake of this email.",I hope this email finds you well.
I don’t need to be included in this.,I do not believe I can add anything helpful to this discussion. Please do me the honor of removing me from this chat and feel free to bring me back into the discussion at a later date if required.
I don’t understand your accent so I can't anwer your question. ,Would you mind just repeating the question?
I don’t want to attend a work event during my personal time.,I’m unable to attend after working hours.
I feel my brain cells dying when I'm talking to you.,"Sorry, I need to focus."
I forgot to check with you that your'e okay with this.,I got the impression that you have been looped in on this plan.
I forgot we have a meeting now.,"Sorry to keep you waiting, i’ll be right there with you in just a minute."
I had to redo your entire work because it was wrong.,I had to make some revisions to your work as I came across some errors when reviewing what you have shared.
I hate to bother you but I need you for a minute.,"Excuse me, do you have a few moments to discuss something?"
I hate to bother you but I want your opinion on this.,"Whenever you have a few moments, I would like to discuss something with you."
I hate your idea.,Let’s circle back on this.
I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.,Can you help me better understand what exactly is it that you require on my end?
I have better things to do.,"I’d love to, but I can’t."
I have more important things to do than talk to you right now.,Your opinion is valueable and I would love to pick up this conversation at another time.
I have more inportant things to do. ,I have a lot on my plate right now. 
"I have my own friends, I don't want to hang out with my colleague after work.","You’re so kind to think of me, but I can’t."
I have no idea how to answer that question.,"That is not my area of expertise, but I will connect with my team and follow up with you on that."
I have no idea how to do this task.,I think I can manage this new task but would love another set of eyes on it just in case.
I have nothing to do with what you just said.,Let me look into that.
I have other plans I'm way more exited about. ,"Sadly, I have something else."
I have told you this so many fucking times.,The information has not changed since the last time it was communicated.
I hope to hear from you soon.,Looking forward to discussing next steps.
I know nothing about this.,"I don’t have experience with this particular subject matter, but i’d be interested in learning more."
"I know you know this, stop acting like you don't.",In case you weren’t aware.
"I made plans I'm actually exited about, so I won't come to your boring meetup. ",Unfortunatelly I’m not able to make it to the meetup.
I need it by next week but I don't trust you to finish it on time.,We need it no later than the end of this week.
"I need it by wednesday, don't fuck me over.","Looking forward to your reply, please make sure it is sent no later than wednesday due to the deadlines we have to adhere to."
I need to explain to you in private why your idea sucks.,"Could you run that question past me again, please?"
I need to recover from the previous annoying task you gave me before I take on another one. ,Circle back to me in a few weeks.
I need your answer and I need it fast.,Thank you for your timely response.
I never agreed to do that.,Seems that we had different expectations on who is responsible for completing this.
I never thought about that.,Let me come back to you on that.
I really don't want to mentor you. ,I really don’t have any openings in my schedule.
I think that's a bad idea.,Maybe we should re think this together.
I told you so and now this is your problem.,"As I did previously note that this was a likely outcome, how do you plan to resolve this?"
I told you so.,"As per my prediction, this outcome does not come as a surprise."
I told you so.,We had discussed this as an outcome. I know that there were a few alternatives and contingencies that some of us came up with individually so this might be a good time for us to reraise that topic as a group.
"I told you this so many times, can you just write it down?",You are encourged to document and save this information so you can access it in the future when you need it.
I totally forgot about your email.,This one fell through the cracks. My apologies.
I totally spaced out.,"So sorry, I missed that. Could you say it again, please?"
"I wanna work here, but if another year goes by without getting a raise I'm going to have to start applying elsewhere.",I'm requesting a meeting to review my compansation and better understand if my salar ywill be adjusted to reflect the market rate and my contributions to the company more accurately.
I want a higher salary than you are offering me.,I was hoping to be in the 180k to 220k salary range for this position.
I warned you it would end up exactly like this but none of you listened. ,"Judging from my instinct, this outcome really doesn’t look unexpected to me!"
I will join the meeting if I'll have nothing better to do.,I will do my best to make it to that meeting.
I would get fired if I did that. ,I really shouldn’t.
I'd rather die. ,I’d rather not.
I'd rather spend my free time on something I actually want to do. ,"Sadly I have something else planned after work, but sure it will be a blast!"
"I'll pass, his new role sounds like a pain in the ass, how does that count as promotion?","I'm flattered you considered me, but unfortunately I'll have to pass this time."
"I'll provide an update when I have one, stop bothering me!","Once I have anything new, I'll make sure you'll be the first to recieve an update."
I'm busy.,I don’t have the bandwidth.
"I'm entitled to take my paid days off, don't make me feel bad about it.","Paid days off are part of my total compensation and I'm entitled to take them, if you have any issues with this I have to loop in hr."
I'm giving you a shit ton of work.,"Please, If it’s not too much trouble."
I'm going to need a whole lot of more information if you want this me to do this.,Please let me know when further details become available as I require more information to successfully complete this task.
"I'm hungover as shit, working from home, don't bother me.",Feel free to ping me.
I'm just waiting for you to head out so I can leave without having to join you. ,"Too bad but I’m head-down right now on a project, so don't wait up on me."
"I'm not a mind reader, how was I supposed to know that?",This was not communicated to me prior to this.
I'm not canceling my vacation because you moved the project timeline!,My time off has been approved and I am not able to adjuct the dates on my end due to last minute changes in our timeline.
I'm not coming to this. ,"Sorry, i've already made other commitments. I hope you understand."
"I'm not going behind their back, you can forget about it. ","No, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to decline."
I'm not going to that meeting because it's after my working hours.,"Unfortunatelly I'm unable to attend a meeting at this time, is there a possibility to move this between 9 to 5?"
I'm not interested in hanging out with you in my free time. ,"I appreciate the invite, but I am completely booked."
I'm not interested.,"Thank you for thinking of me, but I can't."
I'm not spending any more money on coworkers weddings. ,"Honored by the invite, but unfortunately cannot attend."
I'm not staying late to deal with this.,My workday concludes at 5 but I would be happy to prioritize this first thing tomorrow.
I'm not wasting my very little spare time on this. ,As I’m at the end of my rope right now so have to take a raincheck.
I'm not working late today.,Sorry but my evening is booked with other commitments.
I'm stuck until you answer this,I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.
I'm too busy to even concidering taking this on. ,Right now I’m juggling a lot.
I'm too busy.,"Once I complete my current task, I'll be happy to take a look at that."
I'm too overworked to find the energy to hold a fake smile and have small talk with all of you. ,"Would love to join you, but i’m feeling a little overwhelmed with work right now."
I'm using my partner as an excuse not to come. ,"I just got a call and they really need me at home, so sorry I cannot make it!"
I've told you this multiple times.,There seems to be a disconnect here as this information has already been provided.
I’m not attending this meeting because it’s a waste of my time.,Declining this invite as I do not feel as though i’m able to add value to this meeting.
I’m not doing your job for you.,I do not have the capacity to take this on in addition to my own workload but i’m happy to support where it makes sense.
I’m not going to redo work for you. Stop being lazy.,Reattached for your convenience.
I’m not sorry. A five year old could understand this.,Apologies for being unclear.
"I’m not wrong. You said what you said, stop backtracking.","Correct me if i’m wrong, but I recall that you said something else previously."
"I’m sending the same email to thousands of people, your reply would be appreciated.",You’ve probably had ten of these emails so i’ll get straight to the point….
"I’m snowed under with important stuff, this is not one of those things.",Apologies for my delayed response….
I’ve not been properly trained on this.,Are there training courses available in order for me to successfully complete this?
I’ve told this to you many times.,"There is an apparent disconnect here, given that this information has been provided. Im of course happy to re-share this information if you need to revisit it."
If further changes are required do them yourself.,"If further edits are required, I have attached a version of the document that you can apply your edits directly into."
"If I don't get a raise this year, I'm quitting this job.",Are there any actions that I can take in order to be considered for a pay raise this year?
"If i’m doing your job for you, then what are you doing all day?",Are there a higher priority tasks that is consuming all of your capacity at the moment?
If only I cared...,If only I could.
If only I wanted...,If only it worked.
"If we do that, we’re going bankrupt.","If we do that, it will cost considerably more than the current scope."
"If we go with that option, we’re screwed.","We could go for this option, but I think first we'd need to take time outside of this meeting to properly scope out and assess the multi-year maintenance requirements."
If you can’t pay any more then what else can you offer.,"It is understood that there are budget restrictions that limit your ability to increase my salary. However, I would like to understand if additional vacation days, benefits, bonus, and other overall compensation items can be offered."
If you don't rsvp by wednesday don't come crying to me when there is no food for you.,We need a count of how many people to provide food for. Please rsvp by wednesday so we can include you.
"If you don’t like the estimate, you can go fuck yourself.","Sorry, but I can't cut costs anymore and still give you what you want. I don't think we will be a good fit. I will have to pass on this project."
If you expect me to do the job of three people then I expect the salary of three people.,"Are additional team members being added to take on these roles, or will I be expected to absorb these responsibilities? if the latter, i’d be happy to set up some time to discuss appropriate compensation for this role expansion."
"If you have me schduled in meeting all day, when do you expect me to get this work done?","My calander is currently heavily scheduled with meetings. To ensure appropriate time is available to get this done, I can sit out of lower priority meeting or extend the deadlines for my tasks."
If you keep going I might strangle you at some point. ,Let's discontinue this conversation.
If you want it done your way then just do it yourself.,"As you seem to have a very clear vision for the execution of this, I encourage you to take the lead here and i’m happy to support you where necessary."
"If you want me to accept this job, pay me what I asked for.","Unfortunately, we have chosen not to move forward with your proposal at this time. Though your proposal is impressive, we are unable to fit your work into our budget. We wish you the best with your future endeavors and hope for the chance to work with each other in the future."
"If you wanted it to be included in this sprint, you should said something earlier. ","Unfortunatelly, for the current sprint I'm already preoccupied. "
"If you would have read the whole email, you would have seen the answer to this question.",My attached original response contains all the specifics you are requesting.
"If you're gonna present my work, at least give me credit for it.","It has come to my attention that you have presented my work to a wider audience, and wanted to confirm that I was given proper credit for my ideas."
"If your meeting has no agenda, I'm not gonna attend it.",Can you please share an agenda as to what this meeting is?
Is that ok?,Let me know if I should proceed.
Is the manager of this role a micromanager?,How involved is the reporting manager with this role?
It is not working for me.,"Unfortunately, that's just not possible. It won't work out this time."
It would take me too much time to learn how to do this. ,Not sure i’m the best for it.
It's either joining this project or having enough time to sleep. ,It’s not feasible for me to take this on.
It's no urgent just because you want it to be.,"The fact that this is of priority for you was understoof, and I will get to it when I am able to, as I'm currently working on more pressing items."
It's not interesting.,That is not a good match for me.
It's not my fault you procrectinated on this.,"I understand the urgency on this with the deadline approaching. However, I am not able to reschedule my entire week to prioritize this last minute."
It's not my problem.,Looping in my teammate who might be able to assist you with this.
It's time you learn how to spell my name correctly.,I'd appreciate you spell my name correctly when addressing me.
It's too hard.,What a challenge.
Just a heads up.,Be advised.
Just make a decision by yourself!,"Feel free to make the decision, I am not passionate about this and will defer to your judgement here."
Just so you know.,Are you aware?
Leave me alone and let me do my job.,Some space to complete my work that would be very helpful.
"Leave me alone, I can't work like this!",At the moment I'm working on addressing this and would benefit from working independently here.
"Leave me alone, I'm trying to get my work done.",My focus right now is on completing this work and I am limited on time today.
Leave my desk already!,"Unfortunately, now is not a good time."
Let's get started with actual work instead of wasting time on talking.,Get the ball rolling.
Maybe if you communicated that with us sooner we wouldn’t be in this mess.,In the future it is important to share information like this with the team sooner so we might mitigate these sort of issues.
Maybe try not to be such a fuckup next time.,Moving forward.
Mess around and you'll find out.,You are encourged to proof of concept this idea to understand its viability.
My answer is not gonna change if you keep asking every 3 hours.,The information has not changed over time since it was last communicated.
My job has evolved but my salary has stayed the same.,"As my role has expanded since joining the company, I would like to review my compensation so that it better reflects my evolved responsibilities."
My manager would yell at me if I say yes.,You can take it up with my manager if you'd like. 
My workload is so heavy because you keep rewarding good work with more work.,"The opportunity to take on more responsibility is appreciated. However, my workload has become quite heavy and I would like to better understand what items are priorities."
Nice of you to finally get back to me.,Thank you for your response.
No fucking way we're adding that to the project.,That's not in the scope of the project.
No way I commit to anything 2 weeks in advance.,"Sounds great, but I can’t commit."
No way I'm wasting my time on you after work hours. ,"No thanks, I have another commitment."
"No, I will not come to your book club. ","No thank you, but the book club sounds lovely."
"No, I will not take his workload unless I'm taking his salary too.","I can support him when required. However, I am not able to take his workload within my current role. I would love to discuss it if a promotion becomes available."
"No, I will not work on your passion project on my free time. ","Sorry, but no. I have other priorities right now and can't afford to invest additional working hours into additional projects. "
None of us know what we are doing. ,Things are really hectic in the team. 
Not going to waste time on this. ,"Damn, not able to fit this one in!"
Not gonna do your job.,"Sorry, I have already committed to something else. I hope you understand."
"Not the outcome I wanted, but I guess there is nothing I can do. ",Thanks for letting me know.
"Not today, I can't take it. ","Unfortunately, it’s really not a good time."
Nothing you are saying to me makes sense.,Can you present this in a different way? I'm struggling to understand what you are trying to communicate. 
"Oh hell no, it took ages to get everyone to agree on this and we're not opening it to discussion again!",Kindly note that this is contrary to what we agreed upon previously. 
Oops! I completely forgot to reply.,I apologize for the late response.
Our deadline is approaching. Hurry up!,"As our deadline is quickly approaching, can you provide an update as to where you are in completing this task?"
Pay me more if you want me to do work that is not included in my job description.,"As my function has developed, it’s beneficial to book a time to reassess my complete compensation and determine if it aligns with our current scope of work."
Please don't make me have small talk with you.,Now isn't a good time for me.
Please harry up and get this done.,This is important that we have this completed in order to meet our targeted deadlines which are quickly approaching.
"Read the manual I wrote, it exists exactly so you won't have to bother me with the same question every time.",You might find the information here to be very useful. Please review it at your convenience. Let me know if you have any questions regarding it.
Read the whole email before you respond.,The previous communications contain the information you are looking for.
"Regardless of what you say, I'm gonna do it this way.","I appreciate your feedback, and I will keep it in mind as we move forward."
Reschedule this.,Another time might work.
She works for me.,She is from my team.
"Shit, I forgot about your email.",Thank you for your patience.
"Shit, I forgot it was due today!","I will have this information sent to you today, as requested."
"Shit, my bad.",Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.
So you expect me to take on more work but pay me the same?,Is the expectation here that my responsibilities and workload are evolving but I am to remain with the same job title and compensation?
Sorry this is late.,Thanks for your patience.
Sorry to bug you!,Thank you for your time.
"Sorry, I don't want to come. ","Apologies, but I can’t make it."
Stay in your lane.,"Thanks for your input, I'll keep that in mind as I move forward with decisions that fall within my responsibility."
Stop adding me to these irrelevant email chains.,"Moving forward, can we include more of a focused group on these emails to avoid cluttering up the inboxes of those who are not directly working on this?"
Stop adding to the scope of work with false expectations of time.,"As the scope of work is pre-determined, it may be time to sit down and re-visit this to get a better expectation of the project timeline. And, if we need to add to the scope, we can certanily see how much time (expected) will be added to the project."
Stop assigning me so many tasks if you want any of them done.,"As my workload is quite heavy, can you help me understand what I should reprioritise in order to accommodate this new task?"
Stop bombarding me with messages.,"To ensure that information does not get missed, can you please condence your communicationsinto a single email where possible?"
Stop bugging me!,You can be sure that I’ll provide an update when I have one.
Stop cc'ing everyone.,"To optimize communication, perhaps we can target these emails to a moer focused group?"
Stop disrespecting me!,Our effectiveness would benefit from a greater level of respect and professionalism than what I currently feel is being displayed.
Stop emailing me so much.,"You have not heard from me because further information is not available at this time, once I have an update i’ll be sure to loop you in."
Stop excluding me from important meetings.,"Please include me in all future meetings pertaining to this topic, as my involvement is necessary."
Stop excluding me from meetings that I should be in.,"My involvement in these conversations is necessary, so I'm requesting that you start adding me to these meetings moving forward."
Stop following up every 20 minutes. I’ll get back to you when I can.,I would appreciate your patience as I need time to address this. I will provide an update once one is available.
Stop ignoring my meeting requests!,Your attendance is required for this discussion. If this date/time does not work on your end please propose a new time that works for you.
Stop ignoring my messages!,"As this is a busy time, if it is easier for you to jump on a call I am happy to set up some time in order to get this resolved."
Stop ignoring us.,"We know you are busy, and would appreciate your reply when you have time."
Stop micromanaging.,"As I am confident in my ability to complete this project, I will be sure to reach out if or when I require your input."
Stop promising unrealistic timelines.,Can you walk me through your thinking on these timelines? I have some hesitations with the dates shared.
Stop texting my personal phone about work.,Please direct all work related inquiries to my email so communications are kept in one place.
Stop tryig to call me before my work day even starts!,"To contact me effectively, please note that my working hours begin at 9am, and communications recieved prior to this will not be seen."
Stop trying to make me do your work!,"At the moment I am not able to offer you additional support in completing your workload, as I am at capacity with my own assigned responsibilities."
"Sucks for you, but that's the deal.",I hope you can understand.
Thank you.,Your attention to this matter is appreciated.
Thanks for doing your fucking job.,Thank you for your support.
Thanks for the advice I didn't ask for.,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts, I will keep them in mind."
Thanks for this useless email.,"Thank you for sending this email, I will save this information so I can refer back to it as necessary."
That idea is going to be an epic fail.,"This idea is interesting, but I am not in agreement with this idea and have hesitations moving forward."
That idea should be buried and never see the loght of day. ,"That sounds so exciting, but we'll have to wait for another time."
"That is so awkward, why would you invite me to something like that?","Appreciate the offer, but I can't commit."
That is so hard.,That is challenging.
"That is so out of line, why would you think I'd agree to this?",Anything else I can help you with? I’m not comfortable doing that specific task. 
That meeting sounds like a waste of my time.,Right now I’m unable to add value to this meeting but I would be happy to review the notes if you think that would help.
That sounds like a horrible idea.,"Are we confident that this solution is the very best, or are we still exploring possible alternatives?"
That sounds like a you problem.,That falls within your scope of responsibilities.
That sucks for me.,Thank you for letting me know.
"That timeline is impossible, you need to adjust you expectations.","To ensure we are setting realistic timelines, let's break down our milestones to create a more detailed picture of what this project will look like."
That was so easy.,That was very straightforward.
That will never work.,We can definately explore this option but I do have some hesitations on the viability.
That's above my pay grade.,This doesn't fall within my scope of responsibilities.
That's not my job.,"This falls outside of my responsibilities, but I would be happy to connect you with someone who can help."
That's not my problem.,What you are describing is not somehting within my control.
That's not part of my job.,"Th correct person to assist with this isn't me, but I am happy to connect you with my teammate who will be able to help."
That's not what I asked.,"My question may not have been specific enough, I would like to clarify it further."
The way you speak to me is disrespectful.,"You are encourged to reevaluate the way you are speaking to me, as the disrespect you are currently displaying towards me is not welcomed nor will it be tolerated."
Their intwerview was horrible!,They don't feel like the right fit for us.
They don't pay me enough to help you too.,"Unfortunately, I have too much to do today. I can help you another time."
"This decision was made weeks ago, why are you bringing this up now?",These concerns were not raised during any of our previous discussions. Has something changed since the decision has been made?
This doesn't make any sense.,We have a different perspective on this. Do you have a more detailed explanation?
This falls outside of my scope.,"As it turns out, this particular request falls outside of our responsibilities for this project. Im happy to discuss adding this to our scope of work if it’s necessary."
This is not my job and sounds like it would suck all of my time and energy.,"The project sounds exciting, and I can't wait to see the direction you take it. Unfortunately, I don't think I have the capacity to take on this much responsibility outside of my usual tasks. Please let me know if there are any smaller, less time-consuming items I can help with to support the team."
This is not my job.,"Would love to help, but I don’t have the capacity."
This is not my problem.,My recommendation is directing this issue to the it team as they have the proper expertise to best assist you.
This is not remotely interesting enough for me to even concider taking it on. ,"I’m really buckling down on my priorities right now, so I can’t."
This is so unprofessional.,"Put aside any negative feelings, let's bring this topic up at another time."
This is urgent.,Please prioritize this as soon as possible.
This isn't life or death.,Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the urgency here.
This isn't worth my time.,I am swamped with other tasks today.
This isn’t my job – don’t ask me to do it.,Not sure this was meant for me.
This meeting sounds like a waste of both of our time.,"Unfortunatelly I cannot be of value in this appointment, but i’m happy to be available for a review of the important points, or even to correspond by email."
This might sound stupid.,Here’s something to consider.
This question doesn't make any sense. ,Could you please explain a bit more? I'm not sure I understand your question. 
This solution is just bad.,What an interesting solution. Did we also explore other alternatives?
This task sounds scary. ,For now I'm not comfortable doing that task.
Try again.,Let's give it another go. 
Try problem solving on your own before you come to me.,You are encourged to brainstorm possible solutions prior to looping me in for additional support.
Wait until our manager hears about your stupid idea. ,Could we discuss this further in a team meeting?
We all know another meeting will just waste everyone's time. ,Being respectful of everyone's time let's discuss this through email until we have a more defined agenda.
We do not need to have a meeting about this.,"A meeting might not required at the time, and recommend we continue to discuss this over email."
We need an answer now.,"We are eager to get this resolved as soon as possible, so if there is otherwise a better way to reach you, please let me know."
"We’ve already discussed this, read your emails properly.",Per my last email.
Well that was a waste of words. ,Thanks for your opinion.
What am I supposed to do with this information?,Thanks for the heads up.
What do you want?,Anything that you require on my end?
What is this meeting even for?,"Maybe I missed it, is there an agenda?"
What the actual fuck?,"Help me understand the rationale please, I'm out of the loop."
What the fuck did you just say?,Kindly explain your thought process.
What you are saying does not make sense.,We seem to have different understanding on this. Can you elaborate further on your thought process here?
What you are saying is nonesense.,Can you help me understand how you arrived at that conclusion?
What you say sounds crazy.,Would you mind walking me through your thought process?
"When I'll want your input, I'll ask for it.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts, I will be sure to reach out if further input is required."
While I'm on vacation don't try to contact me. Just pretend I don't exist.,While I am off I will not be reachable so please do not expect a response. For urgent matters you can contact my manager.
Why are you asking me? it's not my job.,"Thank you for reaching out, let me redirect you to my teammate who can assist you with this."
Why are you late again?,Thank you for joining us.
Why didn't you ask me for this sooner?,Given the tight turnaround it would have been beneficial to have been looped in on this sooner.
Why didn't you tell me that the first time?,This would have been valuable to communicate earlier on this process.
Why do you think you have a say in this?,There seems to be a disconnect here as this information has already been provided.
Why don't you share important information with the people it impacts most?,This information has a great impact on those who are not being currently communicated with.
Why have you not approved my time off yet?,"Just wanted to confirm that you have received my time off request, and understand if there is anything further you require on my end for this to be reviewed."
Why me?,I don’t think i’m the right person for that.
Why was'nt I informed sooner?,Thanks for keeping me in the loop.
Why would I go to the office if I can do my job from home?,Can you help me understand why I am required to be in the office when I can effectively execute my job responsibilities remotely?
Why would you think I would know anything about this?,That isn't something that is within my skill set. Maybe there is someone else who would be better for that task.
WTF!,Can you elaborate on that?
"Yeah, I don't give a single shit about that. ",That’s not something I pay a lot of attention to.
"Yeah, wer'e not making any last minutes changes just because you think they ""would be cool"".","This is what we agreed on when we started this project, if you wish to make changes please speak with the project manager."
You are capable of doing this on your own.,Your knowledge on this topic is more than sufficient and I encourage you to take the lead.
You are not my boss so stop acting like it.,"In case you were not aware of our organizational structure, I report to alice and take direction from her."
"You are not my boss, stop trying to assign me work.",Have you connected with my manager in regards to me taking this on? as it has not been communicated to me that i’ll be working on this.
You are not my boss.,"I can look at prioritising this behind my assigned responsibilities, though I will have to ensure that with my manager."
You are not pulling your weight on this project.,Our contributions on this project to date do not appear to be equal. Will your involvment be increasing as the timeline continues?
You are overcomplicating this.,Being mindful of timelines. Let’s concentrate on the initial scope.
You are underpaying me.,There is a notable discrepancy between my current salary and the going market rate for the comparable roles.
You are wasting my time.,Being respectful of time let’s regroup when more details become available.
"You can send your email outside of my working hours, but I'm not going to respond or read them.",Please note that my inbox is monitored within regular working hours.
You can't continue ignoring my messages!,Your prompt response would be appreciated.
You didn't answer my question.,"Perhaps it was overlooked, but I asked this question and didn’t get a complete reply regarding it."
You didn't explain this point.,Could you please elaborate on this subject?
"You didn't give me clear instructions, how was I supposed to know that?",I did my best with the information I was provided.
You didn’t answer my question.,"You shared so much today; it is going to take time for it to all sink in. I was jotting down some key points along the way. I also wrote down a few questions, and they weren’t answered when you finished. Do you mind if I ask them now?"
You don't know what you're talking about.,Your input is so valuable.
You don't let me talk.,Can I just say something here?
You don't understand me.,Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.
You don’t have a choice.,Thanks in advance.
You fucked up.,"Well, you’ve provided us all with a great opportunity for education on this matter."
You go over my work so much you may as well just do it yourself.,Your thourogh attentiveness on my deliverables is apprecisted. To ensure we are not duplicating work please let me know in the future if you'd like to take this on yourself.
"You know this already, and denying that will now make you look stupid.",As no doubt you are aware….
"You messed it up last time, it better not happen again.",I am bringing this to your attention so we don’t have the same outcome as we had last time.
You messed up. Don’t do it again.,"Going forward, I would prefer that you…."
You missed it.,Just wanted to bring to your attention.
"You need to start pulling your weight, I can't keep doing your work for you.","You're responsible for completing this, my own workload is demanding and doesn't lend me the time to complete this for you."
You promised to deliver it two days ago. I can't wait anymore. ,You need to have it finished by the end of the day.
"You should be the one doing this, not me.",My understanding is that this is your responsibility. If that is not the case please let me know.
You're crazy thinking I will spend my weekend working on this project.,"Thank you for the offer to do the project, but this weekend doesn’t work for me."
You're holding everyone up by not completing this task.,Just checking in to see if you have an eta on when this will be completed. Your task needs to be done in order for us to continue working on our pieces.
"You're not my boss, asshole.",Could I pick up with you after the meeting to discuss this in more detail?
You're not my boss.,You can refer to my direct manager if you want this task to be added to my workload. 
You're so wrong it hurts.,My feelings on this topic are very different. 
You're trying to rip us off.,We're looking for a better price.
You're wrong.,We view this differently. 
You’re an idiot.,I find your ideas to be both thought-provoking and challenging to implement.
You’re wasting everyone’s time.,Let’s take this offline.
You’ve had more than enough time – where’s what I asked for?,Friendly reminder.
You’ve really pissed me off.,:)
Your communication could not have been less clear.,I'm struggling to understand your vision here.
Your job is what I say it is.,"This is not exactly what you wanted, but this is what I need you to do."
"Your manager gave this task to you, stop trying to dump it on me, It's not going to work. ","Would love to be able to assist you with this task. However, our supervisor originally assigned this task to you, and the task isn't within the scope of my responsibilities. I'm going to politely decline, and I recommend speaking to management to find a solution."
Your micromanaging isn’t making this go any faster.,"Though I appreciate your attention to this, I feel as though I could be more productive if I had an opportunity to work independently here."
Your mistake was stupid.,Can you think of a way we can avoid this in the future?
Your'e asking for too much.,We'll need to manage expectations.
Your'e not doing your job properly and it's making more job for me.,"As I noticed that there are a few tasks that are not being completed properly, I wanted to check in and see if you wanted to go over them together to avoid rework on my side."
"i shit you not, this llama rules",I really think this llama might be a good choice all things considered
We will install it on AWS by the end of the year. ,"Our journey to the cloud will reach GA by the end of fiscal year 2023, by leveraging our strategic partnership with Amazon, a major rain maker in the space. "
We don’t wanna do this. ,This effort does not align with our core competencies nor values.  
What are you doing? ,Looks like you may need some assistance
"I hate you, please stop emailing me","Thanks for you remarks, I will get back to you as soon as we begin working on this topic."
Can you please do what I asked you to do?,I would appreciate your prompt help on this matter.
Are you nuts? What were you thinking when you scheduled this for 8am? ,"A friendly reminder,  8 am is a bit uncomfortable for us, next time please consider rescheduling"
Where are you? The meeting started 5 minutes ago ,"Hi, are you available to join the meeting?"
Look it seems that your objection is based on emotional need not logical,"I hear you objection and respct it. However, there may be some emotions that are mixed in your decision "
Da fak this task schedule is stuck for so long get your shit done and your asses wiped already!,I wanted to know if there is any reason for the delaysin the project. We shoukd be moving forward 
i hate your idea,"It's a great idea, but..."
My request is not done yet. What the fuck?!,"I see that my request has not been processed since we last spoke, please advise."
Your idea bores me to death,Thanks for sharing!
I have better things to do than attending this meeting ,Unfortunately I won’t be able to attend this time. 
Please stop talking during my presentation,Let's take this offline
That's not relevant,"That's interesting, but let's take it offline"
There will be layoffs,We will expereince corporate synergies
Loads of people will be fired soon,The company is downsizing
It's been too long why don't you answer?,Kind reminder
You are wasting my time,Let's take this offline
This is nit the time nor place for this,Let's take this offline
"Why don't you try to solve the task at hand, instead of pushing your grandiose plans to solve problems nobody asked you to solve?",I think that would be a very impactful second phase but I suggest we keep your eyes on the prerequisites to make sure we can deliver the entire project on time
t me check and I’ll get to you,I will need to socialize it with a few other stakeholders and revert
What took you so long?,Thanks for the quick turnaround
The idea is useless and we don't want to do it ,"The idea is very interesting,  but we will need to check if we have the sufficient bandwidth to prioritize it."
Why you are not answering ,Just a kind reminder
Have you completed the task?,I want to touch base on our task
"I need you to do this with me for the first time, I have no idea what I'm doing",Can you please onboard me
We have a good improvement,We were able to achieve significant uplift in performance
I didn’t understand any of the 3 options listed,Can you please elaborate on the 3 options you suggested?
I don't know,Let's talk about it later
Let's meet to discuss project status,I've set a meeting to have a discussion around status on the project
I hate it that you didn't share this information with me,Thank you for sharing! Let's keep each other well informed in the future as well!
